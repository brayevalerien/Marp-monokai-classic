# Monokai Classic

A dark theme for [Marp](https://marp.app) inspired by the Monokai Classic theme.

Adapted from the Dracula theme by *Daniel Nicolas Gisolfi*.

# Equations

There is support for inline equations which allow to define $z \hookrightarrow \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$, and use it in a follow up display equation like the following.

$$
\begin{align}
x_t &= \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} z \\
x_{t-1} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \left( x_t - \frac{1 - \alpha_t}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}} z \right) + \sigma_t \epsilon
\end{align}
$$
Note that this document uses `mathjax` but `katex` can be used too, changing the properties at the top of the source code.

# Tables

Tables are inspired by the clean $\LaTeX$ tables.

| Country | Industry      | Tool             | Daily active users |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| USA     | Technology    | ChatGPT          | 2461               |

# Figures

Images are resized to fit the page, but it still isn't optimal. Add more lines here to see how the image can go out of the slide.

# Multiple figures

Use html and css as a hacky way to get multiple figures next to each others.

<style>
.noborder tbody tr:last-child td {
    border-bottom: none !important;
}
</style>
<table class="noborder" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; border: none;">
  <tr>
    <td style="border: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><img src="https://fastly.picsum.photos/id/743/1280/720.jpg?hmac=6q5cVCPLG7Z2UT22COPlJA63uPQdVyZODV_b-qUIKic"/></td>
    <td style="border: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><img src="https://fastly.picsum.photos/id/634/1280/720.jpg?hmac=s-kfmL1yZuJUYra7m42xOhnm5nDitQpvy810fXn8cSk"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

This isn't the best solution, if you have anything better please [open an issue](https://github.com/brayevalerien/Marp-monokai-classic/**issues**).

# Blockquotes

As a wise man (Einstein) once said,
> Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas.

Multi-line quotes are supported too:
> I wonder where I'll float next?
> 
> â€” The barrel boy

# Code formating

Surround text with backticks like `theme.set("monokai")` or use tripple backticks.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch

conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64) 
out = conv(x)
print(out.shape)  # Expect torch.Size([1, 16, 64, 64])
```

Language can be specified after the first triple backticks.
